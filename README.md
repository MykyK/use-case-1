# Country Information App

## Application Description
The Country Information App is a web application built using React. It provides a straightforward interface for users to filter, sort, and paginate through a list of countries. By making use of various inputs such as country name, population, sort order, etc., users can customize the list of countries displayed according to their needs. The app fetches the list of countries from an API and allows for client-side operations to manage how the data is displayed. This is particularly useful for researchers, students, or anyone interested in gaining insights into countries based on various attributes like population, capital, and region.
